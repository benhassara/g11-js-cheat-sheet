# JavaScript Cheat Sheet

> Last updated: 07/14/2015

## Primitives
Primitives are the basic building blocks of JavaScript.
- `null` - intentionally valueless
- `undefined` - value has yet to be defined
- `string`
- `boolean -`true`and`false`
- `number` - integer or float

## Variables
- Variables function as containers for values.
- Allow you to pass values around and refer to them with a set name.
- The name should be meaningful and it must be unique that follow the JavaScript [naming conventions](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp).
- Declaration syntax: `var varName = varValue`
- Variables can have their values reassigned later with another assignment statement: `varName = newValue`

## Math Operators
- addition (`+`)
- subtraction (`-`)
- multiplication (`*`)
- division (`/`)
- modulus (`%`)
- The mathematical operators can be combined with the assignment operator (`=`). - ex: `+=`

## [Logical Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators)
- and (`&&`)
- or (`||`)

## Comparison Operators
- greater-than (`>`)
- less-than (`<`)
- greater-than or equal (`>=`)
- less-than or equal (`<=`)
- equal (`==`)
- not equal (`!=`)
- strict equal (`===`)
- strict not equal (`!==`)

## Conditionals
- Conditional statements control the flow of a program.
- Conditionals are done with `if...else if...else` blocks

  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
    //some code
  } else if (condition) {
    //some code
  } else {
    //some more code
  }
  ```

- The `else` block is usually your catch-all or default behavior block.
- `switch` statements can also be used to control program flow based on the value of a sentinel variable.

  ```javascript
  switch (expression) {
    case someVal:
      //do things
      break;
    case 1:
      //do things
      break;
    case "blue":
      //do things
      break;
    default:
      //default behavior
  }
  ```

- The `default` block gets executed if `expression` doesn't match any of the cases.

## Loops
- Allow you to keep running a certain piece of code for a certain number of iterations.

### `while` loops:
- Will execute and continue to execute as long as the Boolean expression given to the loop evaluates to `true`.

  ```javascript
   while (someBooleanExpression) {
     //do stuff
   }
  ```

### `for` loops:
- `for` loops are useful for when you know how many times you want to iterate because you are explicitly setting the number of iterations with either a primitive value or a variable.

  ```javascript
  for (var i = 0; i < stop; i++) {
    //do stuff
  }
  ```

  1. In the above, `var i = 0` is the expression that defines where you want to start the `for` loop.
  2. `i < stop` defines where you want to stop the loop.
  3. `i++` defines how you want to change `i` after each iteration.
  4. The general pattern is: `for (start; stop; change)`.
  5. The `start` expression is executed before the first iteration of the loop.

## Functions
- Allow us to capture and reuse blocks of code.
- Should have a single defined purpose.
- Can be defined using either _expression syntax_ or _declaration syntax_.
- Expression syntax:

  ```javascript
  var myFunction = function(){
    //do stuff
  }
  ```

- Declaration syntax:

  ```javascript
  function myFunction() {
    //do stuff
  }
  ```

- JavaScript functions can take zero arguments, or as many arguments as you want.
- Functions can take and deal with optional arguments as well. If you do not give a parameter that the function is expecting, JavaScript will set that parameter to `undefined`.
- Will return `undefined` unless you use a `return` statement in the function body.
- When a `return` statement is executed, control breaks out of the function.
- **Parameters** are the variable names you use when defining a function - ex: `function myFunction(thing1, thing2)`.
- **Arguments** are the values that you supply to a function when you call it - ex: `myFunction(32, true);`

## Scope
- Variables that are defined outside of any functions are part of the _global_ scope.
- Global variables can be accessed by any other piece of the script.
- Variables defined within a function are part of that function's _local_ scope.
- Local variables are created each time a function is called. The values are not shared between function calls.
- Descendant (child) scopes are always aware of the variables within their ancestors' (parent) scope.
- Ancestor scopes are _not_ aware of the variables within their descendants' scopes.
- You can pass variable values outside of the function by returning its value.
- [**Hoisting**](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp) is when you reassign a global variable's value within a function.
- You can avoid hoisting by always using `var` when declaring variables.
- Hoisting example:

  ```javascript
  var someVar = 0;
  console.log(someVar);
  >> 0

  function myFunction() {
    //hoisting
    someVar = "cat";
    return "No problems here. Move along, move along."
  }

  myFunction();
  console.log(someVar);
  >> cat
  ```

## String Concatenation
- Joining two or more strings together.
- Example:

  ```javascript
  var lastName = "Williams";
  var midName = "Dee"
  var fullName = "Billy " + midName + " " + lastName;
  ```

- You can build strings with the `+=` operator:

  ```javascript
  var someString = "Mary";
  someString += " had a little lamb";
  //the above means the same as:
  someString = someString + "had a little lamb";
  ```

- You can concatenate different types of primitives together into one string.

## `alert`, `prompt`, and `confirm`
- The `alert` function allows you to show the user pop-up messages in an OK or Cancel message box.
- The `prompt` function works in a similar way, but provides a text input field for the user to enter input.
- Text received by the `prompt` function is received as a string.
- `confirm` produces a message box as well, but when OK is clicked it returns `true` otherwise it returns `false`.

## Useful Methods
- `str.length`: the length of the string `str`.
- `str.toUpperCase()`: returns the uppercase version of `str`.
- `str.toLowerCase()`: returns the lowercase version of `str`.
- `str.parseInt()`: convert a valid string into an integer.
- `str.charAt(i)`: returns the character in a string at index `i`.
- `obj.toString()`: returns the string representation of an object.
- `data.length`: the number of elements in the array `data`.
